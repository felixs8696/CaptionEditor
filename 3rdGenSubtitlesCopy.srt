00:00:09,15 --> 00:00:11,10
I can't believe he broke up with me

00:00:11,13 --> 00:00:12,16
Who? Peter?

00:00:12,18 --> 00:00:13,17
Yeah Peter

00:00:13,17 --> 00:00:14,11
What did he do?

00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:16,13
Okay. To be fair, I saw it coming

00:00:16,13 --> 00:00:18,19
But I thought I would be the one to
break up with him first, you know?

00:00:18,19 --> 00:00:19,22
Oh nooo

00:00:19,22 --> 00:00:23,03
So like okay but like he never smiled at me

00:00:23,04 --> 00:00:24,04
He doesn't even smile?

00:00:24,04 --> 00:00:27,03
He doesn't smile and like he always gets salads.
He's obsessed with salads

00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:28,11
EW who eats vegetables?

00:00:28,15 --> 00:00:32,01
Yeah like every time we went out to eat, 
he would always get himself a salad

00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:32,13
Gross...

00:00:32,15 --> 00:00:33,15
And he would never buy me food

00:00:33,15 --> 00:00:35,09
Like he even went to Taiwan for my birthday

00:00:35,11 --> 00:00:36,02
What the heck?

00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:37,13
Isn't that so ridiculous? So ridiculous...

00:00:37,17 --> 00:00:39,20
Anyways, ugh, I'm SO PISSED

00:00:39,20 --> 00:00:41,05
What happened?

00:00:41,22 --> 00:00:43,12
It's a really long story

00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:47,22
You know what? He sucks

00:00:47,23 --> 00:00:49,20
I think you should just
find another boyfriend

00:00:49,21 --> 00:00:51,20
Peter doesn't deserve you

00:00:51,21 --> 00:00:55,22
Um, I don't want another boyfriend
I'm so over this boyfriend thing

00:00:55,23 --> 00:00:58,12
No, I'm serious. You should
find someone else that's better

00:00:58,12 --> 00:01:00,04
Do it for me?

00:01:00,05 --> 00:01:01,00
No

00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:02,00
Why not?

00:01:02,01 --> 00:01:04,21
Cause I just got off of a
relationship with Peter

00:01:04,22 --> 00:01:08,06
Well, Peter is terrible. Just find
someone else that's better than him

00:01:09,00 --> 00:01:13,00
You know what? You're right.
He doesn't deserve all this

00:01:13,01 --> 00:01:14,02
Like, come on

00:01:14,03 --> 00:01:15,04
Yeah

00:01:15,15 --> 00:01:18,04
Alright.
We should find you a new boyfriend.

00:01:18,05 --> 00:01:19,00
How are we going to do that?

00:01:19,01 --> 00:01:21,02
We can use Tinder

00:01:24,00 --> 00:01:27,00
Eh, nah
mmm - mm

00:01:27,09 --> 00:01:31,12
Wait, isn't that the guy that
just opened the door for us?

00:01:31,13 --> 00:01:33,05
I saw him just now

00:01:33,06 --> 00:01:34,06
I don't remember

00:01:34,07 --> 00:01:35,15
Dude, he's really cute

00:01:35,16 --> 00:01:35,18
I mean, he's okay, but I-

00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:39,09
No no no, trust me, he's
even better in person

00:01:40,04 --> 00:01:41,17
I think you should go
on a date with him

00:01:41,18 --> 00:01:43,03
Yvonne: Okay I'm going to swipe right
Vivian: You should swipe right

00:01:43,04 --> 00:01:44,08
Okay, I'm going to swipe right, but like-

00:01:44,09 --> 00:01:47,01
Wait wait wait, also message him your
number so he can contact you

00:01:47,02 --> 00:01:48,20
Wait no, why?

00:01:48,21 --> 00:01:54,06
No, so he can reach out to you first
Trust me, just do it this time

00:01:54,23 --> 00:01:58,14
Wh- oh-okay...

00:02:00,20 --> 00:02:06,07

00:02:37,13 --> 00:02:39,17
We can’t do this. I’m sorry.
We’re broken up.

00:02:39,18 --> 00:02:42,00

00:02:48,15 --> 00:02:49,10

00:03:41,09 --> 00:03:43,02

00:04:05,15 --> 00:04:08,15
Ankit: Hey! You’re Yvonne right?
Yvonne: Yes…

00:04:08,16 --> 00:04:09,02

00:09:28,11 --> 00:09:30,13
Dude, we should get back at him.

00:09:30,14 --> 00:09:31,06
