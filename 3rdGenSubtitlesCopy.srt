1
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,010
I can't believe he broke up with me

2
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:12,016
Who? Peter?

3
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:13,017
Yeah Peter

4
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:14,011
What did he do?

5
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,013
Okay. To be fair, I saw it coming

6
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,019
But I thought I would be the one to
break up with him first, you know?

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,022
Oh nooo

8
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:23,003
So like okay but like he never smiled at me

9
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,004
He doesn't even smile?

10
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:27,003
He doesn't smile and like he always gets salads.
He's obsessed with salads

11
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:28,011
EW who eats vegetables?

12
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:32,001
Yeah like every time we went out to eat, 
he would always get himself a salad

13
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:32,013
Gross...

14
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:33,015
And he would never buy me food

15
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,009
Like he even went to Taiwan for my birthday

16
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,002
What the heck?

17
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,013
Isn't that so ridiculous? So ridiculous...

18
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,020
Anyways, ugh, I'm SO PISSED

19
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,005
What happened?

20
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:43,012
It's a really long story

21
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,022
You know what? He sucks

22
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,020
I think you should just
find another boyfriend

23
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:51,020
Peter doesn't deserve you

24
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:55,022
Um, I don't want another boyfriend
I'm so over this boyfriend thing

25
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:58,012
No, I'm serious. You should
find someone else that's better

26
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:00,004
Do it for me?

27
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:01,000
No

28
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,000
Why not?

29
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,021
Cause I just got off of a
relationship with Peter

30
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,006
Well, Peter is terrible. Just find
someone else that's better than him

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You know what? You're right.
He doesn't deserve all this

32
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,002
Like, come on

33
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,004
Yeah

34
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:18,004
Alright.
We should find you a new boyfriend.

35
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:19,000
How are we going to do that?

36
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:21,002
We can use Tinder

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Eh, nah
mmm - mm

38
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:31,012
Wait, isn't that the guy that
just opened the door for us?

39
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,005
I saw him just now

40
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:34,006
I don't remember

41
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,015
Dude, he's really cute

42
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:35,018
I mean, he's okay, but I-

43
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:39,009
No no no, trust me, he's
even better in person

44
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,017
I think you should go
on a date with him

45
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,003
Yvonne: Okay I'm going to swipe right
Vivian: You should swipe right

46
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:44,008
Okay, I'm going to swipe right, but like-

47
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,001
Wait wait wait, also message him your
number so he can contact you

48
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:48,020
Wait no, why?

49
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:54,006
No, so he can reach out to you first
Trust me, just do it this time

50
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:58,014
Wh- oh-okay...

51
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,007

52
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,005
Woah woah woah

00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:12,000
Ankit: Hey Michelle
Michelle: I'm back baby

00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:16,007

Alright here. Okay, you good?
Michelle: Why won't you kiss me?

62
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:37,012
We’re broken up. We can’t do this-

63
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,017
We can’t do this. I’m sorry.
We’re broken up.

64
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:42,000

72
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:08,015
Ankit: Hey! You’re Yvonne right?

122
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:28,015
Ohh yeah.

123
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,018
Hey Alyssa, it's Ankit. Uh,

00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:11,006
He's such a sweetheart!

128
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,007

What?

131
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,003
You should like- give him
a hard time for me

132
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,016
So I can like see how he acts
under pressure for me, you know?

133
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,010
Vivan: I'll go see if he's a good guy
Yvonne: Yeah, exactly

134
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,021
And then I'll see if you
should actually date him

135
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,006
You know, Vivian, you're the most

144
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:06,000
You know I've never liked

145
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:10,017
You know I've never liked
any girl the way I like you?

146
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:17,016
You know I've never liked any

147
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:23,011
Wait. Just don't touch me. Please.

148
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:30,000
Hey Ankit!

149
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:33,017
Hey... Yvonne. What-

00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:35,020
Good. Are you still up for tonight?

151
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:40,014
Umm. Yeah, I'm a little busy, so

152
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:44,003
Yvonne: Yeah.. sure.
Vivian: Wow..

153
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:48,012

00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:49,017
but Ankit's supposed to be dating me

155
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:51,014
Wait, are you guys talking about Ankit?

156
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:53,017
Yeah, wait are we talking

157
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,011
Vivian and Michelle: Ankit Bhat??

158
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,018
Vivian: What?
Yvonne: Wait... hold on

159
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,019
What's going on?

160
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,004
He did the same exact thing to me!

161
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,020
Vivian: Wait what do you mean?
Yvonne: Wait, what did he do?

162
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,021
I have a lot to tell you guys

163
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:09,014
So, uh I had a really
fun time tonight

164
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,019
We should do this again sometime

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,015
Alyssa: Yeah we should
Ankit: Yeah? Alright, see ya

166

00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,021
Alyssa! I need to talk to you!
[screams loudly]

168
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:25,002
Gas-ped! Are you serious?

169
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,010
Yeah. How could he date all of us at
the same time. That's so messed up.

170
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,013
Dude, we should get back at him.

171
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:31,006
But how?

172
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:35,006
